Salutations people of GitHub

It is I, LeeLeeGMOSphipidip, it is only important that GMOS stands for Grand Master of Swag. 
I'm a relatively new developer so far specialising in Android development but I'm very very hungry for more.
Give me instructions, i'll tell the device how to execute them, and hopefully, Bob will be your uncle.
